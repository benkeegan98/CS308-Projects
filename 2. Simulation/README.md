simulation
====

This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

Names: Ben Keegan, Samantha Whitt, Amber Johnson

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: all properties files in the resources folders

Interesting data files: xml files in the xml folder (for each simulation)

Features implemented: play a simulation, change between simulations with buttons, step through a simulation, speed up 
the simulation via slider, show grid lines if desired, 

Assumptions or Simplifications: We assume that there is no user input besides choice of what we give
