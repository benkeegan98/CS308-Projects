## General Feedback

1. Need a welcome page


## GAE FeedBack

1. Brief instructions would be helpful because first tab as Obstacles is not intuitive
2. Connect points when drawing a map
4. Like that the enemies are queued when put in a wave
5. Like layout of Level Config tab
6. Rules condition is a good idea
7. Rules condition is not intuitive (at present)
8. When points are drawn in a path, not intuitive on how to connect it to a spawn point
9. When points are drawn in a path, not intuitive how the path is followed (like that order of placement matters) - either add numbers or draw path
10. Like the green button feedback after submitting the map
11. Like the clicking to place a point
12. "Spawn time", "wave" is  weirdly and is not intuitive what that means
13. Lots of people clicking around the tabs - not intuitively organized / separated
14. When creating objects, determining size / health is confusing because there is nothing to compare inputs to. Add units and presets
15. Want feedback when a tower is selected, or a prompt that confirms/activates selection
16. Gray out buttons that can't be used 
24. GAE could be expanded as it look like it's mispelled and supposed to say "GAME" 
2425. Tab closing should be implemented
2526. Selecting an image might be a better approach than typing 



## Game Player Feedback
1. Commons often involved lack of detail (ex. what does size mean)
2. Consider using sliders for health
3. Associate projectle types with an image
